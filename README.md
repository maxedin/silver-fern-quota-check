silver-fern-quota-check
=======================

Application to automatically check whether SFJS visa is availible

If you failed to submit visa on time you can check the status of the quota by logging on to Online Services on the website. The Silver Fern Job Search Online page will be updated when places are returned to the quota following a declined, withdrawn or cancelled application. There is no automatic system to alert you that a place has been returned to the quota. The only way to know is to log in and check the Online Service on our website for updates.

The only purpose of the project is to create appropriate alert system. Currently application able to check quota in random period of time and send email, SMS or do custom action.

This is an open source project. If you know how to fix a bug or want to improve functionality you are welcome! Just let me know =)
